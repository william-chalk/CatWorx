# CatWorx

# Description
## Use C# to build a console app that creates employee security badges for a rapidly expanding startup, CatWorx. We will use the .NET framework to import libraries that let you read and write to the file system, query APIs, and generate images.

# This process includes the following
- Set up a C# environment
- Declare and use typed data
- Print output and read user input from the console
- Store collections of data in Arrays, ArrayLists, and Dictionaries, and Boolean values
- Declare and call methods
- Declare a statically typed variable
- Use namespaces and statements to organize code and classes to implement object-oriented architectures
- Interact with users via the command-line interface (CLI)
- Iterate using for loops
- Use pseudocode to break down each step ahead of time and outline your workflow
- Compile and run application in VS Code
